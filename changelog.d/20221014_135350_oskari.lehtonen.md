## Fixes

- Add option to return binary and instance labelled mask from the dataloader. Previously binary was returned with `return_inst` flag which was confusing.
- Fix the `SegmentationExperiment` to return preds and masks at test time.

## Features

- Add a Wandb artifact table callback for loading a table of test data metrics and insights to wandb.
